Project Analysis

Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

The main contribution of our work is to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn. The model developed in this work uses machine learning techniques on big data platform and builds a new way of featuresâ€™ engineering and selection.

Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.
Installation

The code in this project is written in Python 3.6.6 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit). The following additional libraries have been used:

    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    plotly
    sklearn
    warnings
    time
    graphviz
    yellowbrick
    xgboost
    imblearn (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE))

Metric

The following metrics have been used to compare the model performances:

    Accuracy
    Precision
    Recall
    F1 score
    AUC ROC

File Descriptions

The Jupyter notebooks included in this project are:

    Telecom Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb.ipynb

Data files (under data directory):

    data/WA_Fn_UseC_Telco_Customer_Churn.csv

Results

The following classifiers have been compared:

    Logistic Regression
    Random Forest
    Decision Tree
    KNN
    

The results achieved the above classifiers give an output of customerID, churn and prediction, with prediction being a probability of how likely a customer is to churn, targeting the customers who haven't churned but are likely to.
